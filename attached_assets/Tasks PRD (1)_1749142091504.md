## **Product Requirements Document: Task Management System**

**1\. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a robust Task Management System. The system will feature a comprehensive swcrm\_tasks table to store task details and a user-facing Task Page with advanced capabilities. The goal is to provide users with powerful tools to create, manage, filter, and track tasks, thereby improving organization, productivity, and collaboration related to sales and operational activities.

**2\. Goals**

* To provide a centralized system for managing all tasks.  
* To enable users to efficiently organize and prioritize their workload through customizable views and advanced filtering.  
* To facilitate seamless linking of tasks to relevant CRM entities (Contacts, Companies, Opportunities, etc.).  
* To support recurring tasks, reducing manual recreation.  
* To allow for efficient bulk management of tasks through import and export functionalities.  
* To provide clear visibility into task ownership, due dates, and status for both individuals and managers (MODs).

**3\. Target Users**

* Sales Representatives (primary users creating and managing tasks).  
* MODs (Managers/Oversight personnel reviewing task completion and adherence to expiration dates).  
* System Administrators / Sales Operations (for bulk data management).  
* "Sidekick" Users (users to whom tasks can be assigned/linked).

**4\. User Stories**

* As a Sales Rep, I want to create tasks with detailed information, including name, category, due date, priority, and specific instructions, so I can clearly define my work.  
* As a Sales Rep, I want to link tasks to relevant users, companies, proposals, opportunities, notes, or designs, so I have all context readily available.  
* As a Sales Rep, I want to be able to create and save different task list views, including global templates and my personal templates, so I can quickly access pre-filtered lists relevant to my workflow.  
* As a Sales Rep, I want to filter tasks based on any field detail, such as date (today, future, past, greater/less than), assignee, linked entity, status, or priority, so I can easily find the tasks I need to focus on.  
* As a Sales Rep, I want to set tasks to repeat (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) after completion, so I don't have to manually recreate recurring activities.  
* As a Sales Rep, I want to update the due date of my tasks as needed.  
* As a Sales Rep, I want to update the status of my tasks (e.g., "Not Started," "Complete") to reflect my progress.  
* As a MOD, I want to view tasks by their expiration\_date to review and see Sales Rep compliance, noting that this date cannot be edited by the Sales Rep.  
* As a Sales Rep/Admin, I want to bulk export tasks based on my filtered criteria, so I can use the data for reporting or external analysis.  
* As a Sales Rep/Admin, I want to bulk import new tasks from a CSV file, mapping columns to the appropriate fields, so I can efficiently create multiple tasks at once.  
* As a Sales Rep, I want to customize the columns displayed in my task list view (e.g., Contact Name, Opportunity details from linked items), so I can see the most relevant information at a glance.  
* As a user, I want the system to record when a task was created and last updated.  
* As a user, I want tasks to have a unique ID for easy reference.

**5\. Features (Functional Requirements)**

**5.1. Task Data Model (**swcrm\_tasks **table)**

| task\_name | text | New 21-500 Account \- Review and Reach Out | The name or title of the task. |
| category | text | CALL | Category of the task (e.g., CALL, EMAIL, MEETING). |
| date\_due | date/time | 05-10-2025 | Due date for the task. Can be moved by the Sales Rep. |
| expiration\_date | date/time | 05-20-2025 | Date by which the Sales Rep must have the task done. For MODs to review; cannot be edited by Sales Rep. |
| priority | int | 1 | Priority of the task (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high). |
| status | enum | Not Started | Current status of the task. Options: "Not Started," "Complete." (Presented as a dropdown). |
| task\_details | text | *Example provided* | Detailed description of what needs to be done for the task, including links to documents or best practices. |

**5.2. Task Page Capabilities/Functions**

* **Saved Task List Views:**  
  * Ability to create and save different task list views.  
  * Support for global template filter options (available to all users or specific roles).  
  * Support for personal template filter options (saved by and for individual users).  
* **Advanced Filtering:**  
  * Filters should be able to look at any field details from the swcrm\_tasks table.  
  * Custom filtering capabilities for dates (e.g., "today," "future date," "past date," "greater than X date," "less than X date").  
  * Filter by who the task is assigned to (task\_owner, Assign\_to\_sidekick).  
* **Task Linking:**  
  * Ability to link a task to a Contact (User), Company, Opportunity, Proposal, and/or Design.  
  * All these linking options are optional for each task.  
* **Repeating Tasks:**  
  * Allow tasks to be configured to repeat (e.g., weekly, daily, monthly) if marked complete and a repeat interval is requested.  
* **Bulk Export:**  
  * Allow users to bulk export tasks based on filtered criteria. (Presumably to a CSV or similar format).  
* **Bulk Import:**  
  * Allow users to bulk import new tasks from a CSV document.  
  * The system should map data from CSV headers to the appropriate task fields.  
  * New, unique task\_ids will be created for imported tasks.  
* **Custom Task List Views (Column Configuration):**  
  * Users should be able to choose which columns are displayed in their task list view.  
  * This includes displaying details from linked items, such as Contact Name, Opportunity details, etc.

**6\. Data Requirements / Backend Considerations**

* The database schema must accurately implement the swcrm\_tasks table structure outlined above.  
* Backend logic is required to handle the creation, reading, updating, and deletion (CRUD) of tasks.  
* System for managing relationships between tasks and other entities (Users, Companies, Opportunities, Proposals, Designs, Notes, Promotions).  
* Implementation of task recurrence logic (e.g., creating new task instances based on repeat rules upon completion of the current task).  
* Robust CSV parsing, data validation, and mapping capabilities for the bulk import feature.  
* Secure and efficient data export functionality, respecting applied filters.  
* User authentication and authorization to manage access to tasks, global vs. personal views, and bulk operations.  
* Mechanism to handle the special case for task\_created\_by where "Jason" indicates creation by Survey/New Account Profile.  
* The expiration\_date field must be non-editable by Sales Rep users.

**7\. Design and UX Considerations**

* **Intuitive Interface:** The Task Page should be user-friendly, allowing for easy creation, viewing, and modification of tasks.  
* **Filter Accessibility:** Filters should be easily accessible and intuitive to configure complex queries.  
* **View Management:** Simple controls for creating, saving, loading, and managing global and personal task list views.  
* **Column Customization:** A straightforward drag-and-drop or checklist interface for selecting and ordering columns in the list view.  
* **Bulk Operations:** Clear feedback during bulk import/export processes, including progress indicators, success messages, and error reporting (e.g., for CSV import validation failures).  
* **Linking UI:** An easy way to search and link tasks to other CRM entities.  
* **Repeat Task Setup:** Clear options for defining recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).  
* **Read-only Fields:** Fields like expiration\_date should be visually distinct or disabled for Sales Reps to indicate non-editable status.

**8\. Future Considerations / Out of Scope (for this iteration)**

* Detailed specifications for linked\_swcrm\_promotions\_id (data type, linking mechanism).  
* Notifications or alerts for upcoming or overdue tasks.  
* Advanced workflow automation based on task status or other triggers.  
* Calendar integration for task due dates.  
* Time tracking against tasks.

**9\. Success Metrics**

* Increased task completion rates.  
* High user adoption of the Task Page and its advanced features (saved views, filters).  
* Positive user feedback on ease of use and efficiency gains.  
* Reduction in manually recreated recurring tasks.  
* Effective use of bulk import/export features for data management.  
* Improved visibility for MODs into task adherence and completion.
